### About Me

I like to build things, products, prototypes, half-finished experiments at 2am. Some make it to production, others exist purely for the joy of figuring out how they work. I've been writing code for over a decade, but the curiosity hasn't worn off yet.

By day, I juggle IT infrastructure and software engineering, solving problems across systems, automation, and security. By night (and weekends), I run **[Nanware](https://nanware.uy)**, my personal workshop where I explore game development, tinker with new tech, and chase whatever idea won't leave me alone.

I'm particularly drawn to understanding *how things work under the hood*. Whether it's reverse-engineering classic arcade movement, figuring out why a procedural algorithm produces certain patterns, or digging into how a device communicates over BLE, the investigation is half the fun.

Versatility is the game. Creativity is the fuel.

### Currently Building

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**[Pac-Ztec](https://nand3z.itch.io/pac-ztec)**

A 3D Pac-Man reimagining with an Aztec twist. Built in Unity, focused on recreating the precise grid-based movement that made the original tick. Custom waypoint system, procedural maze generation using recursive backtracking with braiding, and way too much time thinking about how ghosts should behave.

The goal isn't just to clone a classic, it's to understand *why* it works. Every mechanic is an excuse to dig deeper.

**Tidal Treachery**

Mobile arcade-exploration game. Snake meets pirate adventure: navigate an ever-moving ship through procedural oceans, collect loot, raid islands, upgrade your vessel. Roguelike structure with meta-progression between runs.

Constant motion as the core constraint. Simple touch controls, one-handed play, 15-45 minute sessions. Currently in early design exploring the core loop.

**[The Watcher](https://play.unity.com/es/games/083c80c7-8fef-4417-914f-7a714aa2841f/the-watcher-academic-terrain-demo)**

A peaceful first-person sandbox built to explore Unity's terrain tools, quest mechanics, and interactive world systems. Less about winning, more about wandering and seeing what the engine can do.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**[Ringalytics](https://github.com/nandez/ringalytics)**

Open source Android app for reading smart ring data. An AI-assisted experiment built with Flutter, inspired by the Gadgetbridge project. Born from curiosity about what data these devices actually collect and how to access it without vendor lock-in.

### Tech Stack

Tools I reach for depending on what I'm building. Game dev, web apps, infrastructure automation, or whatever rabbit hole I've fallen into this week.

### Down to Collaborate

**Game jams.** Short bursts of creative chaos, weird ideas, tight deadlines, and shipping something playable by Sunday night. I've done several Brackeys jams and I'm always looking for the next one. If you're putting together a team and need someone who can code mechanics, debug at 3am, and still find it fun, hit me up.

**Open source.** Three years running Linux turned me into a believer. There's something satisfying about contributing to tools you actually use. I've made contributions to a few projects and I'm always open to jumping into something that matters to the community, especially if it involves reverse engineering, automation, or developer tooling.
