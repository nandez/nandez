### About Me

I like to build things, products, prototypes, half-finished experiments at 2am. Some make it to production, others exist purely for the joy of figuring out how they work.

By day, I juggle IT infrastructure and software engineering, solving problems across systems, automation, and security. By night (and weekends), I run **[Nanware](https://nanware.uy)**, my personal workshop where I explore game development, tinker with new tech, and chase whatever idea won't leave me alone.

Versatility is the game. Creativity is the fuel.

### Currently Building

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Pac-Ztec**

A 3D Pac-Man reimagining with an Aztec twist. Built in Unity, focused on recreating the precise grid-based movement that made the original tick. Custom waypoint system, procedural maze generation, and way too much time thinking about how ghosts should behave.

`Unity` `C#` `Procedural Generation`

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Tidal Treachery**

Mobile arcade-exploration game. Snake meets pirate adventure: navigate an ever-moving ship through procedural oceans, collect loot, raid islands, upgrade your vessel. Roguelike runs with meta-progression.

### Game Jams

I've participated in several **Brackeys Game Jams**, building small games under tight deadlines with weird constraints. It's chaos, it's fun, and sometimes the result is actually playable.

### Down to Collaborate

**Game jams.** Short bursts of creative chaos, weird ideas, tight deadlines, and shipping something playable by Sunday night. If you're putting together a team, hit me up.

**Open source.** Three years running Linux turned me into a believer. I've contributed to a few projects and I'm always down to help with something that matters to the community.
