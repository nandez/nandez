# Hey there, I’m @nandez

I love to crafting experiences through code.

---

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a tech-savvy problem solver, game developer, and founder of **Nanware**, a digital workshop where creativity meets technology. My work spans full-stack development, IT infrastructure, and cybersecurity compliance, blending technical depth with strategic thinking... and plenty of nerdy side quests along the way.

---

### 👀 Interests
- Game development (mostly Unity, but not limited to it)
- Software engineering (not as fun as game dev, but it built the foundation)
- IT asset management & automation (Intune, Azure, PowerShell, scripting in general)
- Developer tooling (Node.js, TypeScript, .NET, CLI utilities)
- World-building, storytelling, and fantasy-inspired systems

---

### 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Procedural world generation & AI-assisted game design
- Reactive UI patterns and monorepo architectures (Nx, Angular)
- Cross-platform tooling and build automation
- Cybersecurity and ISO 27001 compliance

---

### 🤝 Open to Collaborate On
- Game jam or experimental indie game projects
- Developer tools for workflows
- Creative narrative systems and technical design challenges
- Open-source projects focused on infrastructure automation or educational tooling
